writen initially by locust in 3/17/2023. Locust got some other aliases. Or not. Whatever. 
"Locust, without any other aliases" is the alias. Alias for what? Secret :>

Anyway, let us begin.

WHAT IS THIS TEXT?
    This is a commentary on the state of the code. This is basically
    a companion to my handwritten notes i (should) take about what 
    I'm doing to keep shit tiddy and organized. Or something like 
    that. It also serves as a good training for my english, which needs
    some brushing up, though I try to only write documentation in english as to
    keep a somewhat consisten standard. Don't count on this, though...

STATEOFTHECODE - 17/03/2023

    datechecker is done and working. still trying to do 
    something about idpack. Missing most features, though.
    Might kill myself. We'll see about that.

    Idpack - inprogress
        Testers - NOTDONE
        Class init - Completely fucked up & NOTDONE!
        Checkers - NOTDONE!
            idtesting: the firewall against fuckups. 
                Major fuckups from the user are expected. Not something we 
                can fret about. Major fuckups from the coder, though.
                That's something quite fretable, if I dare create this word.
                Random 
    Main - Not even started
        csvhandling sould be done here, 
        since most of the stuff will be custom
        anyway.
    Datechecker - Done!
        Might need to do some bughunting, though.
    funny - is funny.

    recommended by rkaze:
        install vampiro extension.

STATEOFTHECODE 18/03/2023
    Went ahead and finished the idtesting from idpack. failcodes are 
    also present there. Thing is, you present him a Random generated
    id and its fucked up, he busts your ass and, along with the failcode
    he butchers your variable, which is mildly interesting, i'd say. 


    and i do.
