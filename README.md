# contractmanager
Some python scrypt to mimic apcfinal, but more robust and with more planned and implemented functionality :>

What does it do (or at least, what is it supposed to do)?
---------------------------------------------------------
  it handles contracts between parts. Any terms, any parts. It stores
  the terms with a hash along the info on the contractor and contracted.
  .csv and stuff. 
  Then it outputs a code, so that only the parts of the contract can access the
  info on the contract.

How does it do it?
------------------
  With a bunch of bad bad code. That works half the time and the other half 
  it is literally trying to end your lineage.
  
Why?
----
  For the funny, of course.
